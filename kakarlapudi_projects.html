        <dt>Project: <i>Alexa</i> Python Image Manipulation </dt>
        <dt>Course: CSE (Computer Science and Principles of Engineering)</dt>
        <dt>Duration: approximately 2 weeks (March 2018) </dt>
        <dt>Objective: Create a brand image that represents their product 
        (Alexa), in a memorable fashion, using Python. The purpose is to increase sales. 
        </dt>
        <dt>Type of Project: Python Image Manipulation - Partner Project</dt>
        <div><p class="container">My partner for this project was Akamai Wong. 
        The plan for the image was to compile logos that the brand uses (i.e. 
        Dominos, Spotify, Phone, etc) and to use a function that pastes the images
        on the cropped image of the Alexa circle that we had. After, we had to 
        modify images under one directory by resizing, cropping, and changing 
        transparency values. We had a difficult time in creating loops for the 
        code to be less file specific. We overcame this struggle using external 
        resources as Google. We recorded our process in our Python Project 
        Notebook. We displayed significant teamwork by dividing up parts of the 
        project, so we would have equal amounts of work; if we had problems
        we would help each other out.

        <dt>Project: Oh My Spikes</dt>
        <dt>Course: CSE (Computer Science and Principles of Engineering)</dt>
        <dt>Duration: mid September 2017 - October 2017</dt>
        <dt>Objective: Use obstacles to create difficulty for user, by avoiding spikes</dt>
        <dt>Type of Project: MIT App Inventor - Partner Project</dt>
        <div><p class="container">For the game, we had to first duplicate the original code that was given to us and 
        plan for the tweaks and changes that we would eventually do. Those changes included 
        animation of the character involved in the game, higher speed rate, level progression, 
        creating more obstacles, and more. Throughout the entirety of the project, my partner 
        and I focused on increasing difficulty of the game, and I made sure that the styling
        was pleasing and created obstacles. However, if there is one thing that I could change
        about our app, it would be focusing on the glitches that were introduced with the app,
        as most of our criticism was involved within that. Although, our project turned out 
        decent for drag and drop coding and I was satisfied with our result. We kept track 
        of our making of the project by keeping a MIT App Inventor Project Design Notebook.</p>

        <dt>Project: Solar Hydrogen Vehicle</dt>
        <dt>Course: POE (Principles of Engineering)</dt>
        <dt>Duration: November 2018</dt>
        <dt>Objective: Test hydrogen and solar cells to see which would be more compatible
        to power a vehicle. </dt>
        <dt>Type of Project: Design + Build Project</dt>
        <div><p class="container">
        For this project, we had to design a vehicle that could accodomate a hydrogen cell and a solar cell
        to power the vehicle, and provide a recommendation the company, Tesla. Tesla needs insight for how to use solar and hydrogen to power their cars. We are providing them with a prototype of a vehicle that will be able to use the two power sources in the vehicle that we built. 
        We needed to create an efficient vehicle in which the power source can be easily switched between solar and hydrogen in order to determine the better source
        . The original design of the hydro-solar car consisted of three wheels, a simple gear train, and a platform for mounting the hydrogen and solar cells.
        Later, we made adjustments to the vehicle by making the sizing changes to be smaller and more compact in order to comply with the requirements. Our final recommendation for Tesla is to go with a solar-powered car. A solar-powered car is faster and more efficient overall.

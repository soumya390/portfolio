          Hello, my name is Soumya Kakarlapudi and I currently am a 
          sophomore in Dublin High School. My friends and family, faith
          , and education are the most important things in my life. 
          My inspiration comes from my sister, as I have never seen 
          such a dedicated and passionate person about her career. In 
          10 years, I see myself graduating with my degree in computer
          science and having a potential career in the field that I 
          enjoy. I would like to be a web developer one day because I 
          enjoy creating, styling content and coding. My first exposure to the 
          computer science field was in 6th grade, learning how to use basic HTML functions.
          In addition, a past experience during 8th grade, Girls Who Code 
          inspired me in innovation and building technology that serves a purpose. I think that 
          being a web developer is a great way to involve technology 
          and my qualities of organizing information and styling. To 
          reach my future goal, I would like to enroll in more classes
          that are in the engineering pathway to broaden my choice. I 
          am currently in Honors Principles of Engineering (POE). In addition, I am in the process of 
          getting a possible internship at a company and I am part of 
          many clubs that will help me reach my future goal. Throughout my 
          experience in Dublin High School, I am eager to establish life-long 
          connections that inspire me to work harder to reach for my goal and
          encourage following the career pathway, Computer Science, in which I am 
          passionate about. I know that I will be learning everyday and that is what is
          special about technology. There is always new things and it's exciting that it is a process that is always changing.

            <dt><i>Volunteering</i> - I learned how to give back to others 
            and a big part of volunteering is communication and 
            organization with the expectations to adapt quickly to the
            environment and people that you are surrounded with. 
            Organization is a big part because the information should 
            be organized. </dt>
            <dt><i>Dance</i> - I learned how to listen properly that is not 
            only in the expression of dance, but teaching instructions
            and I had to learn how to apply the knowledge I received 
            from my instructor, and use it in my dancing. In addition, 
            creativity is a big part of dancing because there are 
            expectations that everyone has to learn the same piece, 
            but make their dance special and unique. </dt> 
            <dt><i>Fallon Pride Team</i> - I learned valuable leadership skills
            that I can apply because I was expected to know how to 
            direct others and be able to coordinate and plan special 
            events. There is also a good sense of communication involved
            that I was expected to handle well. <dt></div></div>
